CS_520_Project

1. Implemented different kinds of A* search algorithms like forward A*, adaptive A*, and backward A* in a generated acyclic maze to find a path from randomly generated source to destination.
2. Analysed the performance of algorithms based on the number of A* calls, the number of nodes expanded and the time taken to reach the destination.
